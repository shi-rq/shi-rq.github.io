### About

Iâ€™m a third-year undergraduate student majoring in artificial intelligence at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am a member of SJTU MVIG lab under the supervision of Prof. Cewu Lu, mainly researching in the field of human pose estimation. Also, I'm a member of the NExT++ Center of National University of Singapore, working on video-related multi-modal learning as an online intern.

Through three years' study of undergraduate courses, I've gained basic knowledge of machine learning and coding ability on certain research topics. I'm especially interested in computer vision, reinforcement learning and natural language processing.

Currently, I'm working on two projects relating to 2D pose estimation: one introducing normalizing flow to heatmap supervision, better adjust the trivial groundtruth with Gaussian / Laplacian distribution; another separating the localization task and scoring task from a single heatmap network, improving the supervision precision.

Also, I'm working on video moment retrieval in two directions: one using pretrained models to conduct retrievals zero-shot / one-shot; another targeting on improving model efficiency by adopting methods like knowledge distillation.

### In-course Academic Projects

**Building LeNet**

_Artificial Intelligence Introduction_

- Using only numpy package to build LeNet in python. Writing feature engineering, network classes, layer classes and backward propagation rules all by myself.
- Optimizing convolution layer and its back propagation with matrix operations for speed-up.
- Reaching 97% accuracy on MNIST dataset.

**Spoken Language Understanding**

_Natural Language Processing_

- Constructing BiLSTM baseline to extract semantic slots and values.
- Introducing multi-head attention mechanism to discover differences comparing with historical data.
- Additional FNN to predict slot value frequency. Dropout on the most frequent one to emphasize unknown slot values.
- Using pos tagging to introduce part of speech information.

**Implementation of SQIL on NGSIM for Imitation Learning on Driving**

_Reinforcement Learning_

- Implement SQIL on NGSIM dataset.
- Introducing batch norms and forced backups to effectively avoid Q value overestimation in SQIL.
- Adding gumbel randomization to improve both robustness and flexibility, performing better than DQN and soft Q learning.

**Attacks and Defenses in Images**

_Machine Learning_

- Building attack and defense policies on CIFAR 10.
- Applying JSMA, momentum, Surrogate Loss, etc. in attack task.
- Using random network head and regularization in defense task.

**Restaurant Recommendation**

_Data Mining_

- Participating in restaurant recommendation challenge on Kaggle.
- Using methods like clustering and node2vec to analyze the problem bottom up and top-down.
